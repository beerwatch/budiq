Alarm clock linked to google calendar api.

This is a rewrite of a 5 years old project using Raspberry PI 2B with RTL8188 WiFi dongle, MAX7219 display controller with 2 white leds in series per segment and TD62783 high-side driver, PAM8403 power amplifier, and two step-down converters.

I used Python, GLib, GStreamer, and Google API examples.
